CitizenMP Server Updater
========================

_by Carl Kittelberger_

Updates, compiles and sets up your CitizenMP server automagically!

Features
--------

- Compatible with both Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5+ and Mono 3.0+ (Mac OS X support planned)
- Creates ready-to-use start scripts for your platform
- No extra setup besides requirements listed below needed

Requirements
------------

First of all, you'll need Windows or Linux to run this tool. Currently, since no libgit2 binaries can be provided for Mac OS X, this tool won't work there. Here's the guaranteed compatible list of OS this tool can be run on:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or higher, including 14.xx
- Debian 7.x (Wheezy) or higher, including testing and sid installations
- Every other currently stable Linux distribution with up-to-date Mono
- Any Windows operating system with .NET Framework 4.5 Full on it

To run this program and the resulting server, you need the following components:

- _On Windows:_ .NET Framework 4.5 or newer ([Download](http://microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30653))
- _On Linux:_ Mono 3.x or newer, runtime + xbuild files ([Installation instructions](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/))

*Note that Mono 2.10.x/.NET 4 are not supported!*
If you use a Debian-based distribution that still only offers Mono binaries older than 3.x, you must [switch to Xamarin's Debian repository](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/).
